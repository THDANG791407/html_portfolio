<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, my name is Dang and I am passionate about programming. 
  However, my journey has been a bit of a tragedy. After graduating with a degree in financial accounting, 
  I worked for two years at a leading retail company in Vietnam. While accounting provided a stable job, 
  I found myself going to the company every day and returning at the end of the month just to receive my salary. 
  At times, I even had to work until 4 a.m. to meet deadlines.</p>
  
<p>It was during this process that I realized my true passion was in technology, not accounting.
   So, I made the difficult decision to quit my job and pursue my passion.</p>

<p>Currently, I am studying information technology at Tra Vinh University and also self-studying machine learning through resources like YouTube and Udemy. 
  In addition to my studies, I also spend time trading to earn some income to support myself.</p>
